# GENERATOR/GENERATOR-LIB README

Please note that this project was written out of the inspired need to generate
code IMMEDIATELY.  Its general status is that of a semi-working prototype with
little to no (promise of) documentation as of yet.

It was a side-project I rushed and eventually consolidated quite a bit --- but not
enough ;p

A general re-write is in order; hence you might think of this as a prototype for
educational reasons and/or pre-release phase.
