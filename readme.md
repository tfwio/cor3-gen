# GeneratorTool

This project was written out of the inspired need to generate code IMMEDIATELYâ€”which
means that the inception point of this program was simply for a data-admin familiar/proficient
in CSharp.NET data semantics and WPF binding.
In other words, it was a work in progress and became stable within the condition
that you know how the application works, or proficient enough a programmer to get this working.

[issue #4](https://github.com/tfwio/cor3-gen/issues/4)
The application is not yet quite prepared for public domain release primarily due to my withholding
the configuration files which generally put the application into action.
