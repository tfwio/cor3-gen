# Generator

This is the first version of a tool I had written which I thought might be useful. **THE PROGRAM IS OBSOLETE** by way of the introduction of a newer version: GeneratorTool.  Neither of these projects are complete, however functional and buggy in their way.  This `generator.csproj` space will be maintained until the newer GeneratorTool application fulfills the features presented here.

    - Now that the project compiles, there are a few things that need to be looked at and worked into the new application.
